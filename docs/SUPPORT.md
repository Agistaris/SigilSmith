# Support / Donations

For a BG3 audience, the most frictionless setup is:
- Ko-fi for one-off tips (easy $5 default, supports custom amounts)
- GitHub Sponsors for recurring support

## Setup

1) Create accounts:
- Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com
- GitHub Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors

2) Add handles to `.github/FUNDING.yml`:

```yaml
github: [yourhandle]
ko_fi: yourhandle
```

3) Add a short Support section in `README.md` and release notes:

Suggested copy:
"If SigilSmith saves you time, consider a $5 tip on Ko-fi. You can choose any amount."

## Optional: PayPal

Only add PayPal if users request it. It adds another surface area and usually sees lower conversion than Ko-fi.
